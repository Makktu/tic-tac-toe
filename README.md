# The Official ODIN Project Tic-Tac-Toe Project

### I did my own 'noughts and crosses' version using my basic knowledge; now for the more advanced version using Constructors and custom methods.

-   Begun 31-Aug-2021.

-   1-Sep-2021: laying the Constructor building blocks in place.

-   13-Sep-2021: after genning up some more on Constructors and the whole OOP theory thing, returning to branch off and try this again.
